Encapsulation
  Member and Catalog do not expose their internal collections directly.
  Borrowed items and catalog items can only be modified through the methods borrow, return_item, add, and get.

Use of Inheritance
  Book and Dvd both inherit from the Item base class.
  They share common behavior but have individual days_allowed values to provide different loan limits.

Use of Composition
  Catalog has a collection of Item objects.
  Member has a collection of borrowed item IDs.
  Both classes manage these internal lists rather than exposing them.

Polymorphism
  Any subclass of Item can be treated as an Item.
  The program can call item.days_allowed() without knowing whether the object is a Book or a Dvd.
